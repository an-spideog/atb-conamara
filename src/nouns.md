# 6. Nouns
## 6.1 Formation
There's a couple of points to mention regarding the formation of the noun in the dialect.

*-a* /ə/ at the end of some words ending in a consonant in the standard: *dorna, posta, rása, rotha, úlla.*

Broad *-r* in *dochtúr, saighdiúr, táilliúr.*

*-éara* instead of *-éir* in nouns for types of people: *feilméara, siúinéara, strainséara.*

The last consonant is often slender in the second declensions: *bois, bróig, cluais, cois, cnáimh, cuinneoig, gail inín, láimh, méir, muic.* (Broad consonants sometimes in some of those examples.)

## 6.2 Gender
*céibh, loch, páí* are feminine: *ceann na céibhe, timpeall na locha, an pháí.*

*curach, foireann* are sometimes masculine: *an curach, an foireann.* (But a feminine pronoun with *curach* like *bád*.)

*cleachtadh* lenites adjectives following it: *Tá cleachtadh mhaith agam air.*

## 6.3 Genitive without declension
There's a lot of adjectives which aren't declined in the genitive: in the dialect these are in the 4th declention. Amongst them are nouns ending in *-a (feilméara, posta), -adh (samhradh), -amh (scaitheamh), -acht (cosúlacht), -ú (athrú).* And these common nouns: *blas, cead, cion, culaith (cola), dream, neart, pian, rud.*

*ceann* ('one') isn't declined: *luach an cheann seo.*

## 6.4 Nouns ending in *-ach*
In masculine nouns ending in *-ach*, the *-ach* is dropped in the genitive: *bealacht, leath bealaigh (beala)* (3.10). Other examples: *aonach, cladach, éadach.* *iascach* isn't declined: *bád iascach* is what's said.

In feminine nouns the *-ach* changes to *-aí: gealach, solas na gealaí.* Other examples: *báisteach, cisteanach, toirneach.*

## 6.5 Irregular Nouns
*bean: cainteoir mná,* but normally it's not declined (*togha bean*).  
*deoch:* not declined (*luach deoch*)  
*dreithiúr* (4.4): *fear mo dhreifire*  
*lá:* ar feadh an lae.  
*talamh: tiarna talúna,*  
*teach: bean tí,* but often it's not declined (*ag déanamh teach*).

## 6.6 Usage of the Genitive
It's typical to leave the the noun undeclined after *sórt: cén sórt lá a bhí agat?* Often also after *ar nós, beagán, mórán:*
+ *ar nós an seancharr* (Cois Fharraige)
+ *Tá beagán obaire tosaithe ann.* (Carna)
+ *Ní raibh mórán eolas acu air.* (Ros Muc)

Sometimes nouns are left undeclined in various other cases.

## 6.7 Plural: slenderisation
In the case of a lot of nouns of the of the first declensions, the final consonant is slenderised in the  plural: *an t-asal, na hasail.* Other examples: *bád, cat* (2.20), *cnoc, gasúr, oileán, páipéar, sagart.*

There is a few nouns that are slenderised in the standard but which have a different formation in this dialect. Among those are: *clár, clárachaí* (uaireanta cláir); *crann, crainnte (craínnte); éan, éanachaí; focal, focla; leabhar, leabhra.*

## 6.8 Nouns ending in *-ach*
There are 3 plural formations found among nouns ending in *-ach.*
+ (a) *-ch* in the middle: *an bacach, na bacaigh (baca).*
	+ Other examples: *bairneach, coileach, gliomach, ronnach.*
+ (b) *-aí* instead of *-ach: an bealach, na bealaí.*
	+ Other examples: *cladach, éadach, portach, ualach*
+ (c) *-aí* as a suffix: *an bhaintreach, na baintreachaí.*
	+ Other examples: *cailleach, curach, eangach, girseach.* Often *gliomach, ronnach* also have the (c) formation.

(b) Formation is most common in nouns for people from certain countries: *Éireannach, Meireacánach, Sasanach.* But *Francach* has formation (a).

## 6.9 The suffix *-anna*
*-í* is added to the suffix *-anna* in this dialect: *ceisteannaí.* Many monosyllabic nouns have this plural formation: *bláth, carr, deis, dream, loch, scoil.* It's what most monosyllabic loans have as well: *aint, bus, farc, mug, pleainc, seans.* The English plural is kept in *lads, sweets*.

## 6.10 The suffix *-acha*

## 6.11 The suffix *-a*
Some monosyllabic nouns of the second declension have the plural suffix *-a* /ə/: *bróg, bróga.* Other examples: *cearc, cloch, cos, lámh, muc, sceach.* But nouns ending *-eog, -óg* have the suffix *-aí: fuinneogaí, neantógaí.*

There's a couple of plural forms for *teach*: *tí* (Cois Fharraige), *titheabhaí* (Carna) are the two most common.

## 6.13 Genitive plural
The genitive plural is only used in set phrases like *geallta bád, beirt bhan, péire bróg, rástaí capall, teach na gcearc, clann inín, clann mhac, ag ceannach muc, ag iascach ronnach, radharc na súl.* (There are a lot of those phrases.)

In other cases the noun is left in the nominative plural normally: *togha na namhráin, ag déanamh báid, trasna na gnoic, go leor portáin óga.*

The article in the genitive plural is followed by eclipsis normally, but sometimes it's left out: *le hais na fir a bhí an t-am sin ann* (Carna) instead of *le hais na bhfir ...*

## 6.14 The vocative case
The last consonant is slenderised at the end of mens' names in the vocative: *a Choilm, a Mhaitéis, a Sheáin.* But *a Liam* without slenderisation.

## 6.15 The dative case
A special form in the dative singular is found in a couple of phrases:

*Tá sé 'na bháistigh (bháiste).*  
*Tá sé as a chéill.*

*'na bháisteach, as a chiall* can be said as well.

*bróig, cois,* etc are dative (and dual) forms originally (6.1): *ar an mbróig, dhá bhróig.* But they're also used in the nominative now.

*Éirinn* is used in both the nominative and the dative.

## 6.16 *tigh*
*tigh* (*tí* or *ti*) is an old dative form. It's used in phrases like *tigh Chiaráin, tigh Mháire, tigh Mhicil.* It can be used for movement or position:
+ *Bhí mé thiar tigh Chiaráin,* i.e. in Ciarán's house.
+ *Chuaigh mé siar tigh Chiaráin,* i.e. to Ciarán's house.

*tigh* is always used in the names of shops and pubs: *tigh Mhoran* (in Carna), *tigh Chlarke* (in Ros Muc), *tigh Mháirtín Mhóir* (in Galway).
