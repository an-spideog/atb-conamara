# 9. Pronouns
## 9.1 *muid*
The personal pronouns in this dialect are teh same as the standard except for *muid* in the first person plural in place of *sinn:*
+ *Is as Gaillimh muid.*
+ *Chuala sé muid.*
+ *Muid féin a rinne é.*

*muid* is put with the verb too, where the synthetic form would be in the standard: *tá muid, rinne muid, bheadh muid,* etc.
+ *muide* is the emphatic form: *Is as Gaillimh muide.*

*sinn* is found in prayers like *go sábhála Dia sinn, Dia idir sinn agus an t-olc.* And *sinne* is the emphatic (9.6) : *lena linn sinne* (i.e. lenár linn-ne).

## 9.2 *tú*
In the 2nd singular there are the two forms , *tú* and *thú*, in the dialect. *tú* comes after verbs as a subject and following the copula: *d'imigh tú, is tú a bhí ann; thú* in other situations: *is as Gaillimh thú, chonaic mé thú.*

In the same way *tusa and thusa: chonaic tusa mise, chonaic mise thusa. Thusa* is normally in the second singular imperative: *bí thusa anseo, déan thusa é.*

## 9.3 *dor*
In places some people have a tendency to use *dor* instead of *siad* following verbs: *bíonn dor anseo go minic, nuair a thiocfas dor arís.* *tá dor* (instead of *tá siad*) is very common.

Many people look at this tendency as a corruption, and learners shouldn't imitate it.

## 9.4 The gender of pronouns
In the case of people, the gender follows the meaning: *is maith an cainteoir é, is maith an cainteoir í.*

In the case of animals, the pronoun agrees with the gender of the noun normally: *is deas an cat é, is breá an bhó í.* But a feminine pronoun is used for *capall: is breá an capall í.*

In the case of inanimate things, the pronoun agrees with the gender of the noun normally: feminine pronoun with *feamainn, móin, trá,* masculine pronoun *gaineamh, portach, uisce.*

Feminine pronouns are used to refer to boats, and often to cars; also often referring to books and newspapers.

Masculine pronouns are used with *áit (is deas an áit é), barúil (sin é mo bharúil féin), caoi (sin é an chaoi), uair (sin é an uair a d'imigh sé).*

## 9.5 The possessive adjective
In the 1st singular *(mo)* the vowel is elided before a noun beginning with a vowel: *m'ainm, m'fhear, m'inín.*

In the 2nd singular *(do)* the vowel is ellided and the *d* is turned into a *t: t'ainm, t'fhear, t'inín.*

In the plural, every person has *a* /ə/ normally:
+ Is ann a bhí muid 'na gcónaí
+ Tá sibh 'na gcodladh
+ Tá siad 'na gcónaí i nGaillimh

## 9.6 Emphasis
To emphasise the possessive adjective the emphatic particle *-sa* is put after the noun in the 1st singular and the 2nd singular: *mo cheannsa, do cheannsa.*

In the 3rd singular it's typical to use the emphatic pronoun: *a cheann seisean, a ceann sise* (stress on the emphatic pronoun).  That's how it is in the plural too normally: *a gcuid bealaí sinne, 'na n-áit sibhse, a gcuid Gaeilge siadsan.*

Instead of *ár dteachna*, *an teach seo againne* or *an teach sin againne* is said. In the same way, *an teach sin agaibhse.* Other nouns which take that formation are: *baile, dream, muintir, tír.*

## 9.7 *cuid*
*cuid* follows the possessive adjective in certain cases.

Before nouns in the plural: *mo chuid beithí, driothárachaí, leabhra, paidreachaí.*

Before nouns that don't have plurals: *mo chuid airgid, anró, cainte, móna, oibre.*

But *cuid* isn't always put before nouns in the plural: *mo chosa, mo lámha, mo shúile,* etc. are what's mostly said.
