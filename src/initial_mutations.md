# 5. Initial Mutations
## 5.1
Through and through the rules pertaining to initial mutations in this dialect are similar to the rules of the standard. But there are a few small differences which are worth drawing attention to.

## 5.2 Lenition of *f*
*f* is sometimes left unlenited, especially when the lenition could make the word hard to recognise. Here are a couple of examples from Carna:
+ *cuid den foireann*
+ *Bhí sé 'na file mhaith.*
+ *Tá sí an-fearúil* (i.e. an-teanntásach).

(Lenition could be found in cases like those as well.)

## 5.3 Lenition of *s*
When slender *s* is lenited, it changed to /x´/ before a back vowel: *shiúil* /x´u:l´/. Before a front vowel it changes to /h/: *sheas* /has/. /x/ in *ó shin* often.

*s* isn't lenited in english names: *a Sarah, Micil Saile.*

## 5.4 Eclipsis following *sa*
*sa* (i.e. *ins an*) is followed by eclipsis: *sa mbaile, sa gcarr, sa bhfarraige.* Because of that, *m* isn't mutated: *sa mála, sa mí.* This eclipsis doesn't affect *d, t: sa doras, sa tine.*

*t* is prefixed to *s* in a feminine noun: *sa tsráid* (ach *sa saol*).

## 5.5 Lenition following *den, don*
*den, don* are followed by lenition: *den chapall, don fhear.* *d, t* don't get any mutation: *den tart, don duine.* But *t* is put before *s* usually: *den tsaol, don tsagart.*

## 5.6 Lenition following *ba*
Often lenition doesn't follow *ba* (the historic form of the copula): *ba col ceathar dó é; ba fear maith é; ba gránna é; an fear ba boichte san áit.* But there usually is lenition on specific adjectives: *ba bhreá, ba cheart, b'fhurasta, ba mhaith, ba mhór.*

## 5.7 The autonomous verb
The past tense autonomous verb isn't lenited normally: *baineadh é, níor tosaíodh é.* Often there isn't lenition on the autonomous verb in other tenses either (especially in Carna):
+ *Ma cailltear é.*
+ *Ní déanfaí anois é.*
+ *Cuirtí amach iad.*

But there's always lenition on *bheifí, bhítí.* Often there's a h before a verb in the past tense autonomous verb especially if there's a particle before it:
+ *Híocadh an t-airgead.*
+ *Níor hathraíodh é ní ba mhó.*
+ *Nuair a hairíodh é.*

## 5.8 Following the verbal noun
There is lenition on a nouns following a verbal noun in common phrases like *ag baint fheamainne, ag baint fhéir, ag cuir fhataí, ag díol mhóna.* Sometimes in other phrases too.
