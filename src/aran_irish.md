# Appendix B: Aran Irish
### 1.
Broadly speaking Aran (the three islands) and Conamara have the same dialect. Anywhere there's a difference between Cois Fharraige and West Conamara, it's typical for Aran to agree with Cois Fharraige. The most noticeable case of that is the loss of /h/ between two vowels: in Aran *san oíche* is said as /sə ˈni:/, *ag ithe* as /ə ˈg´i:/, sruthán as /sra:n/, and so on, just like in Cois Fharraige. However, it can't be said that this /h/ has been completely removed; in certain words anywa it is pronounced sometimes, e.g. *athair* which is said as /ar´/ or /ahir´/.

There are a few minor points of difference between Aran and Conamara and some of them will be mentioned below. In Aran itself there are local differences to note, especially between the three Islands, Inis Oírr, Inis Meáin, and Inis Mór. In Inis Mór there are small differences between the west side of the island and the east side. It's likely that it's mostly differences in frequency; that is, variant A being more common in one place, variant B being more common in another.

### 2. Pronunciation
There are a few minor differences in pronunciation between Aran and Conamara. Among them are the following points.

Sometimes /t´/ (in *te*), /d´/ in (*deas*) are affricate consonants in Aran, i.e. they are like the English consonants at the start of *cheap, jeep* respectively. This trait especially pertains to the two small islands and with Cill Rónáin in Inis Mór. On the west side of Inis Mór these consonants are as they are in Conamara.

In Inis Oírr, /ai/ (not /a/) is used in *aimsir, caint*. (This pronunciation is also found in Cois Fharraige, but it's not common.)

*méidir* is often said instead of *b'fhéidir* in Aran, especially in Inis Oírr.

### 3. Grammar
There are a couple of irregular verbs in Aran worth noting.

***faigh,*** 3rd singular future: *gheobha* /jau/, dependent *ní gheobha* or *ní bhfaighe* /vai/.  
***tabhair,*** 2nd singular imperative: *tiúir* (*tóir* in Conamara); verbal noun *tiúirt.* (Broad *t* in Inis Oírr: *túir, túirt*.)  
***téir,*** 3rd singular future: *gabha* /gau/; 3rd singular conditional *ghabhadh* /ɣaux/.

It's rare that the dependent form *ní dhearna* (3rd singular past of *déan*) is used in Aran, if it's used at all; *ní rinne, go rinne* are what's said. In Inis Oírr the regular forms *dhéan* /jin/, *níor dhéan* are used.

A trait particular to Inis Mór is the use of *muinn* /miN´/ instead of *muid* (personal pronoun, 1st plural). That's a version which used to be found once in other dialects too.

### 4. Vocabulary
There are some special words in Árainn relating to the geography of the region. Here are a couple of examples.

*buaile,* i.e. a small garden which nothing would be planted in;  
*carcair*, i.e. a hill or hillock (perhaps a special meaning of the word *carcair* 'lump');  
*croig* /kreg´/, i.e. 'crag', a bare strip of rock (plural *craga*);  
*róidín,* i.e. 'a little road'.

A word which often comes up in Aran is *in araíocht* /ə ˈnariəxd/, i.e. 'favourable, suitable' (referring to weather): *Má bhíonn an lá in araíocht, Níl sé in araíocht a ghoil amach.*

The adverb of movement *sall*, i.e. *anonn*, is common in Inis Mór, like in Cois Fharraige.

*go háirid* is used in Aran in the sense 'anyway': *ní thiocfaidh sí inniu go háirid* (compare *ach go háirithe* in Kerry). Other phrases used in that sense: *ar aon chaoi* /er´ ˈe:xi:/, *féibí é* (from *pé ar bith é*).
