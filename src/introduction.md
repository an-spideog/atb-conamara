# Introduction
This is a short account of Conamara Irish as it's spoken today, especially among middle aged and older speakers. Not much attention is given to ancient tendencies nor new tendencies which are emerging. This is only basic information about the dialect, the amount a student would want, studying the living language. It's taken that the reader has experience with standard grammar and some understanding of phonetics.

Since this is the dialect most heard on the radio, every learner can benefit from having some knowledge of it. On the other hand, it has to be said that there are some traits of the dialect that aren't advisable for a learner to mimic, because they're too local or too far from the written form. For example of those tendencies the following ones could be mentioned: elision of /h/ in the middle of words (e.g. saying *láthair* as *láir*); pronouncing *ó* as /u:/ beside nasal consonants (e.g. saying *mó* as *mú*); Putting /b/ with pronouns ending in the 3rd person plural (e.g. saying *acu* as *acab*). Those are natural developments of course, that go back hundreds of years. IT doesn't need to be said that there is no fault to be found in their use by native speakers of the dialect.

This small word is based in fair part on the writings of Tomás de Bhaldraithe (1917-1996), a big scholar of this dialect. Most of the samples I heard them in conversation or on the radio.

I am obliged to Dónall Ó Baoill for the trouble he took with the writing and for the edits he suggested. I'm grateful to Áine Ní Chonghaile for doing the typesetting so neatly.
