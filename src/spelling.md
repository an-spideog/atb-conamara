# Spelling
To give examples from the dialect, the standard spelling is used as far as is possible. For example the spelling *samhradh* is accepted although *samhra* is what's said, i.e. the *dh* is silent. A simple rule can be given that *dh* is silent at the end of nouns in this dialect. In the same way the spelling *talamh* can be accepted even though *tala* is what's said: *mh* is regularly silent at the end of two syllable words. Another example: *ag* is written before verbal nouns even though it's just said *a* before consonants; e.g. in *ag fáil*.

When the dialectal spelling needs to be shown the phonetic spelling is given in parentheses: *samhradh (samhra), talamh (tala), ag fáil (a' fáil).*

Sometimes phonetic spelling needs to be used to make a point about inflection. For example, *deireadh* can be written (like *samhradh* above), but in the phrase *chun deire* the phonetic spelling has to be used. *chun deiridh* would have it understood that the noun is declined in the genitive, and *chun deireadh* would look incorrect.

In the case of a single word which has a special form in the dialect the normal spelling with corresponds to that form is used, dialectal spelling as it could be called: *dúin* instead of *dún* (verb), *dreithiúr* instead of *deirfiúr, dríoball* instead of *eireaball,* and so on. There's a list of these words in Chapter 4. Most of the samples of dialectal spelling are found in Connacht texts; e.g. in the writings of Máirtín Ó Cadhain and in folklore stories.
