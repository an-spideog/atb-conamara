# Translator's Note
I translated this book because I think access to dialectal information is very helpful to those just beginning to learn Irish, if you only start learning about dialectal traits when you're able to read books like this in Irish, I think you're starting too late.

The author of this book makes some statements I don't agree with. Specifically he repeats the idea that learners shouldn't use certain dialectal traits, which I entirely disagree with. Learners should speak the language as it's spoken, including *is mú*, *leob*, and *tádar*. I have, however, included these statements in the book for the sake of a faithful translation.

It's likely I've made typos and mistakes throughout the translation, please let me know if you see any. I often tried to maintain the original formatting of the book however messy that may have been, keep that in mind.

The original is available in Irish under the name *An Teanga Bheo - Gaeilge Chonamara* written by Séamas Ó Murchú, it's an amazing resource and I'd highly recommend it if you can read Irish.

I apologise for the guerilla nature of this translation, if anyone involved in the making of the book would like me to take this down, just let me know and I will.
