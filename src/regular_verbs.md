# 13. Regular verbs
## 13.1 The suffix *-idh*
*-idh* = /ə/ in the 3rd singular future, conjugation 1: *brisfidh* is said as *brise,* *caithfidh* as *caithe,* and so on.

*-idh* is silent in the 3rd singular future, conjugation 2: *ceannóidh* is said as *ceannó, imeoidh* as *imeó,* and so on.

## 13.2 The suffix *-igh*
*-igh* = /ə/ in the 3rd singular past (and 2nd singular imperative), conjugation 2: *cheannaigh* is said as *cheanna,* *d'imigh* as *d'ime,* and so on.

*-igh* is silent in *dóigh, léigh,* etc. (first conjugation). *suigh* is pronounced as /si/ normally.

## 13.3 The suffix *-adh* (3rd singular)
*-adh* = /əx/ in the 3rd singular conditional: *bhrisfeadh* is said as *bhriseach*, *chaithfeadh* as *chaitheach,* and so on. It's the same with the habitual past and in the imperative.

In conjugation 2 *-dh* = /x/: *cheannódh* is said as *cheannóch,* *cheannaíodh* as *cheannaíoch,* and so on.

It's typical to have /t´/ instead of /x/ in those forms before the proonouns *sé, sí, sibh, siad;* e.g. *chasfadh sé* is said as *chasat sé,* *bheadh sé* as *bheit sé.* This is the same /t´/ as in *thit sé;* it could also be written as /t̝/. Sometimes the /x/ is kept in this position.

## 13.4 The suffix *-adh* (autonomous)
*-adh* = /u:/ normally in the past autonomous, conjugation 1: *casadh (orm é)* is said as *casú, briseadh (é)* as *brisiú,* and so on. Sometimes -/əv/ is used instead of -/u:/ in Cois Fharraige.

In conjugation 2 *-dh* = /v/: *ceannaíodh* is said as *ceannaíobh.*

## 13.5 *f* in the 3rd singular future
In the 3rd singular future, conjugation 1, *f* is pronounced as follows:
+ /h/ after *l, m, n, r: ólfaidh (ótha);*
+ /h/ after vowels: *suífidh (suíthe);*

devoicing on *b, bh, d, g, mh: féadfaidh (féata), ligfidh (lice), scuabfaidh (scuapa);*  
silent after *c, ch, p, s, t, th: caithfidh (caithe), ceapfaidh (ceapa), feicfidh (feice).*

the /h/ is often dropped, especially in Cois Fharraige; e.g. *ólfaidh* is said as /o:lə/ not as /o:lhə/ But the devoicing (on *b, bh* etc.) always occurs.

## 13.6 *f* in the autonomous future
In Carna *f* = /f´/ normally in the autonomous future, conjugation 1; e.g. in *brisfear, ligfear* (no devoicing), *ólfar.* Sometimes it's a broad /f/

In Cois Fharraige the *f* is often pronounced as in the 3rd singular; i.e. *brisfear* is said as *brisear, ligfear* as *licear* and so on. Sometimes there's a /a:/ in the suffix: *briseár, liceár.*

In conjugation 2 *f* = /f´/ in Carna: *ceannófar* is said as *ceannóifear.* In Cois Fharraige the form without *f* is most common: *ceannár.*

## 13.7 *f* in the conditional
*f* in the conditional is pronounced like in the future.

3rd singular: *bhrisfeadh (bhriseach), d'ólfadh (d'ólthach), ligfeadh (liceach).*

autonomous: *bhrisfí (bhrisfí* or *bhrisí), ligfí (ligfí* or *licí), cheannófaí (cheannóifí* or *cheannaí).*

(The autonomous isn't always lenited)

## 13.8 Synthetic forms
Usually the analytic forms are used in the 1st plural: *ólann muid, d'ól muid, d'óladh muid* (9.1).

There's a synthetic form in the 3rd plural past, conditional, past habitual: *d'óladar, d'ólfaidís, d'ólaidís*

There is a synthetic form in the 1st singular future, but it's not used normally except in response to a question or such:
+ *An ólfaidh tú cupán tae? Ólfad.*

The same with the 1st singular past:
+ *Ar ól tú fuisce ariamh? Níor ólas.*

The synthetic forms in the 1st singular future, past are mostly found in conjugation 1.

## 13.9 Answering questions
There are three ways to give a simple answer to a question like *an ólfaidh tú cupán tae:*
+ (a) *ólfaidh* (the 3rd singular)
+ (b) *ólfad* (the 1st singular synthetic)
+ (c) *ólfaidh mé* (the 1st singular analytic)

(a) and (b) are more or less the same in terms of meaning. (c) is an emphatic answer: both the verb and the pronoun are stressed in it.

## 13.10 The relative form
There is a relative form in the present and future. It's the same as the 3rd person singular except it is lenited and it has /s/ at the end:
+ present *chuireanns, bhíonns*
+ future *chuirfeas, bheas.*

This form is used in the positive direct relative structure:
+ *Céard a bheas agad?*
+ *Céard a cheapanns tusa?*
+ *Nuair imeos na strainséaraí.*

The /s/ is elided before *sé, sí,* etc.

## 13.11 Subjunctive
There's no clear difference between the present subjunctive and the subjunctive except in the case of verbs ending in *b, d, g* and verbs in conjugation 2:
+ future *tóigfidh (tóice), ceannóidh (ceannó)*
+ subjunctive *go dtóige, go gceannaí*

The present subjunctive is used in wishes and sometimes following the conjunctions *go, mara:*
+ *Nár laga Dia thú.* (wish)
+ *Go n-éirí an saol leis.* (wish)
+ *Fan go n-insí mé dhuit.*
+ *Mara dtoige tú mo chomhairle.*

Often the future is used after the conjunctions now: *fan go n-inseoidh mé dhuit.*

Thee past subjunctive and the past habitual use the same form. It's used sometimes after the conjunctions *dá (gá), mara:*
+ *Dá n-éiríodh leis.*
+ *Mara dtaithníodh an áit liom* (Carna).

But often the conditional is used after those prepositions: *dá n-éiroedh, mara dtaithneodh.* It's always the conditional in the case of the verb *bí: dá mbeadh, mara mbeadh.*

## 13.12 Verbal adjectives, conjugation 1
These samples show the formation of verbal adjectives in conjugation 1:
+ *ólta, bainte* (verbs ending in *l, m, n*)
+ *curtha* (*r*)
+ *fágtha (fácaí)* (*b, d, g*)
+ *ceaptha (ceapaí)*, (*c, p, t*)
+ *casta, briste* (*s*)
+ *dóite, suite* (vowel)

As well as *curtha*, the version *curta* exists. Instead of -/i:/, -/i:hə/ is usually used in Carna: *ceaptha* is said as *ceapaíthe*, *fágtha* as *fácaíthe.*

## 13.13 Verbal adjectives, conjugation 2
These samples show the formation of verbal adjectives in conjugation 2:
+ *ceannaithe (ceannaí)*
+ *osclaithe (osclaí)*

-/i:hə/ is used instead of -/i:/ in Carna normally: *ceannaithe* is said as *ceannaíthe.* As well as *osclaithe* the version *oscailte* exists; in the same way, *ceangailte* as well as *ceanglaithe.* Broad *t* in *foghlamta* (*fólamta* or *feolamta*).

## 13.14 Verbal Nouns
There's a good few verbal nouns in the dialect which have a different form than in the standard. Here are some of the most common samples:
+ *aithin: aithneachtáil* (but *is furasta aithint é* 'easily known')
+ *ceannaigh: ceannacht*
+ *creid: creistiúint* or *creistint* (Carna)
+ *fág: fágál* (broad *l* also in *coinneál, tóigeál*)
+ *inis: inseacht*
+ *lag: lagan* (conjugation 1)
+ *lean: leanacht* or *leanúint* (Carna)
+ *nigh: níochán*
+ *taithin: taithneachtáil*
+ *tosaigh: tosaí*

In a couple of cases there are two nouns for one verb with different uses. For example, *casadh (casa)* is the normal noun for *cas: an roth a chasadh.* But *castáil* or *casachtáil* in sentences like *ba mhaith liom castáil leis,* i.e. I would like to meet him.
